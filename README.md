This is actually **Kitchen ML** now. It's still a WIP, but it will run on a raspberry pi and determine the cleanliness of the kitchen . It will use metrics such as, are the counters clear, is there stuff in the sink. And are the cuboards closed.

Models: I'm still experimenting with different models. I expect to be able to do this with a simpler model such as a logistic regression. If not I can experiment with simple nerual networks. As long as the camera doesn't move it should work.
